Executive Summary:
Introduction:
Investment decisions are generally based on assessing the returns from an investment, which also includes the associated risk. Analysing the risk-return profile of an investment provides a clear view of the project's riskiness and profitability, enabling an investor to make an informed decision. In addition, risk-return metrics enable investors to evaluate the performance of different investments about market behavior. These assessments are necessary in formulating the decisions taken by various ranges of risk-taking investors. Risk-return metrics also provide investors with a measure of how much a project can lose over a specific period, enabling them to make informed decisions. Based on the analysis, investors assess which investment will have a higher return for the given risk, allowing them to allocate their capital effectively.
Objective
The goal of the risk-return analysis of four distinct telecommunications companies is to gain a better understanding of their performance over the course of the three-year historical data collection period. With the calculated risk-return metrics, it was easier to compare different companies' stock prices, returns, and associated risks.
